# Platypus Crypto

Platypus Crypto is an ad-free cross-platform robust solution for tracking cryptocurrency assets. Our intuitive interface includes real-time 7-day graphs, current prices and market caps, and percent change over time.

Our customization options allow for the removal of 7-day graphs for a more compact feel and a dark theme.
