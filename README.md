# Platypus Crypto

Platypus Crypto is an ad-free cross-platform robust solution for tracking cryptocurrency assets. Our intuitive interface includes real-time 7-day graphs, current prices and market caps, and percent change over time. Featuring rapid sort, search and refresh features, and support for 32 fiat currencies, Platypus Crypto enables casual and power users alike to monitor cryptocurrency assets on-the-go! Our customization options allow for the removal of 7-day graphs for a more compact feel and a dark theme.
